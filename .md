## Prepare

Data has been scraped from Kaggle and it contains a fictional dataset. The data contains 1000 rows and 8 columns categorized.

The data has been made available by this website (http://roycekimmons.com/tools/generated_data/exams). This is a fictional dataset that you can download and use for educational purposes only.

If there are issues with bias or credibility in this data it will be not considered ROCCC data. ROCCC means your data:

**Reliable**, **Original**, **Comprehensive**, **Current**, **Cited**

I checked data and it will be not considered ROCCC data.
