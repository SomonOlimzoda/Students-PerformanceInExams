# Students' Performance in Exams 

### Introduction

In this project, I will try to answer the key business questions. To do that I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.**

## Ask

Based on the data we can derive many answers. Specifically, I would like to know in what ways male and female students differ. In addition, I will run some other queries to get a better sense of data.

1. What factors influence students' performance in exams?
2. What would be the best way to improve student scores on each test?
3. How effective is the test preparation course?

## Prepare

Data has been scrapped from Kaggle. It contains 1000 rows and 8 columns categorized. It has been made available by this website (http://roycekimmons.com/tools/generated_data/exams). This is a fictional dataset that you can download and use for educational purposes only. 

If there are issues with bias or credibility in this data it will be not considered ROCCC data. ROCCC means your data:

**Reliable**, **Original**, **Comprehensive**, **Current**, **Cited**

I've checked the data it is not considered ROCCC data. 

## Process

#### Tool of your choice

In this step, I should choose a tool I will work with. This step ensures that the data is cleaned and ready to analyze. The steps of confirming this you find in seperate scripts. Since the data is clean and compact, I will be using SQL and R to run quick analysis and summarize our findings using visualizations.

#### Importing data

Data has been imported into R Studio and DBeaver(SQL client software application) as .csv files. 

#### Clean up and add data to prepare for analysis
The content of the data were inspected by using proper commands and queries. 

#### Conduct descriptive analysis
Descriptive analysis we need here is: mean, max, and min. Using aggregate() function enables us to see the average for specified columns. Check R and SQL scripts to see more details.

## Analyze

Now data is stored appropriately and has been prepared for analysis, let's start putting it to work. You can to view the R script and the summary of complete analysis process here.

Different analysis were carried out to perform calculations, identify trends and relationships using SQL queries in DBeaver. You can view my SQL file used for analysis and insights here.

Further analysis were carried out to perform calculations, identify trends and relationships using PivotTable and Charts in Excel. You can view my Excel file used for visualizations and insights here.

## Share

Now that I have performed analysis and gained some insights from data, where we gonna create compelling visualizations in order to effectively communicate to the executive team and share findings. As a tool I chosed to use Tableau. Tableau is a leading data visualization tool used for data analysis and business intelligence helps to create different charts and graphs, in addition to visualizing data through reports and dashboards in Tableau to derive meaningful insights.

You can my view Tableau visualizations here.

## Act

  - It is important that they complete the preparatory courses.
  - It is important for families to increase their education level and be open to learning.
  - It is important that they have a standard plan for food

The number of female students with high scores is more than the number of male students
Male students are more successful in math than female students. But, in writing and reading female students are better.
Among all of the subjects math is the hardest one

Now I have finished creating all visualizations, I will start acting on key findings. Prepare the deliverables Morena asked me to create, including the three top recommendations based on analysis had been carried out.

Key takeaways
Total average trip duration is 44.9 mins casuals, 16.1 mins members
Whether being a member or casual rider, Saturday is the day when bikes are rented most
Casuals spend more time despite the fewer rides and vice versa for members
On weekends, members ride less than casual riders
Casual users ride 2.7-3 times longer than members
My recommendations
The data shows that members rent bikes mainly for regular commutes to work or school. The reason is the number of trips and the average trips duration being consistent every day. Whereas, casual rent is lower from Monday to Friday and increases from Friday and peaks at the weekend. Most likely casuals using bikes for leisure activities(touring the city, sightseeing, etc).

Drop the price of rides for casuals on weekdays because the ride and duration are longer on weekends for these riders. This will spark the interest of casual riders to at least think about it and maybe encourage them to upgrade to an annual membership.

Run a loyalty program where both member and casual riders get bonuses for trips where only member riders are able to use rewards. This may encourage them to sign up for a yearly subscription.

Moreno and the marketing team could set off a marketing campaign at the beginning of March where is the peak of renting bikes for casuals is a month April. Start making ads, promotions, and surveys on social media, and even begin to reward casual riders with a free full ride on any day of the weekday. It can be one of the reasons bike likers would consider getting a twelve-month subscription.
