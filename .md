# Students' Performance in Exams 

### Introduction

In this project, I will try to answer the key business questions. To do that I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.**

## Ask

Based on the data we can derive many answers. Also, I will run some extra queries to get a better sense of data.

1. What factors influence students' performance in exams?
2. What would be the best way to improve student scores on each test?
3. How effective is the test preparation course?

## Prepare

Data has been scrapped from Kaggle. It contains 1000 rows and 8 columns categorized. It has been made available by this website (http://roycekimmons.com/tools/generated_data/exams). This is a fictional dataset that you can download and use for educational purposes only. 

If there are issues with bias or credibility in this data it will be not considered ROCCC data. ROCCC means your data:

**Reliable**, **Original**, **Comprehensive**, **Current**, **Cited**

I've checked the data it is not considered ROCCC data. 

## Process

#### Tool of your choice

In this step, I should choose a tool I will work with. This step ensures that the data is cleaned and ready to analyze. The steps of confirming this you find in seperate scripts. Since the data is clean and compact, I will be using SQL and R to run quick analysis and summarize our findings using visualizations.

#### Importing data

Data has been imported into R Studio and DBeaver(SQL client software application) as .csv files. 

#### Clean up and add data to prepare for analysis
The content of the data were inspected by using proper commands and queries. 

#### Conduct descriptive analysis
Descriptive analysis we need here is: mean, max, and min. Using aggregate() function enables us to see the average for specified columns. Check R and SQL scripts to see more details.

## Analyze

Now data is stored appropriately and has been prepared for analysis, let's start putting it to work. You can to view the R script and the summary of complete analysis process [here](https://github.com/SomonOlimzoda/StudentsPerformanceInExams/blob/main/R%20script.R)

Different analysis were carried out to perform calculations, identify trends and relationships using SQL queries in DBeaver. You can view my SQL file used for analysis and insights [here](https://github.com/SomonOlimzoda/StudentsPerformanceInExams/blob/main/SQL%20script.sql)

Further analysis were carried out to perform calculations, identify trends and relationships using PivotTable and Charts in Excel. You can view my Excel file used for visualizations and insights [here](https://github.com/SomonOlimzoda/StudentsPerformanceInExams/blob/main/Quick%20summary%20of%20analysis.xlsx)

## Share

Now that I have performed some analysis and gained few insights from data, where I am going to create compelling visualizations. As a tool I would like to choose to use Tableau. Tableau is one of the leading data visualization tool used for data analysis and business intelligence helps to create different charts and graphs, in addition to visualizing data through reports and dashboards in Tableau to derive meaningful insights.

## Act

#### Key takeaways

* The number of female students with high scores is more than the number of male students
* Male students are more successful in math than female students. However, in writing and reading female students are better
* Among all of the subjects math is the hardest one
* Students who completed the preparatory courses have higher scores
* An important thing for families is to increase their education level and be open to learning
* A great importance for students is to have a standard plan for food
* The most successful group in exams is group E

#### My recommendations

1. Factors influencing students' performance in exams are the following: parental level of education, meal plan, and preparation course. These three have a positive correlation with each other. For example, students with standard meal plans were more successful in exams than free or reduced ones.

2. One of the ways to improve the student's scores on each test is to increase the parental level of education. For instance, the highest score in math, reading, and writing got a student whose parents had a master's degree diploma. It means the higher the parental level of education the higher scores the student will get.

3. The test preparation course is effective even though math is the hardest subject. Students who completed the preparation courses got higher marks.
