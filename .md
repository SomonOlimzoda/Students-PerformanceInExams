# Students' Performance in Exams

### Introduction

In this project, I will try to answer the key business questions. To do that I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.**

## Ask

Based on the data we can derive many answers. Specifically, I would like to know in what ways male and female students differ. In addition, I will run some other queries to get a better sense of data.

1. What factors influence students' performance in exams?
2. What would be the best way to improve student scores on each test?
3. Does the parent's level of education has any impact on the student's score?
4. How effective is the test preparation course?

## Prepare

Data has been scrapped from Kaggle and it contains a fictional dataset. It contains 1000 rows and 8 columns categorized. It has been made available by this website (http://roycekimmons.com/tools/generated_data/exams). This is a fictional dataset that you can download and use for educational purposes only. 

If there are issues with bias or credibility in this data it will be not considered ROCCC data. ROCCC means your data:

**Reliable**, **Original**, **Comprehensive**, **Current**, **Cited**

I've checked the data it is not considered ROCCC data. 

## Process



## Analyze



## Share



## Act

  - It is important that they complete the preparatory courses.
  - It is important for families to increase their education level and be open to learning.
